# Screen readers

PdfViewerLite works with the screen reader on each desktop: Narrator, NVDA or JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS and Orca on Linux.

## Moving around

- Tab moves along each tool row from left to right, then down the window. Shift+Tab moves back.
- The tab bar, tool bar and sidebar are navigation landmarks. The pages are the main landmark. Find is a search landmark.
- Every button says its action. Buttons with only an icon still have a name.
- List items say what they hold and their place, such as "Page 3 of 40" or "2 of 7".
- Status messages and Read Aloud progress are announced without moving focus.

## Reading pages

- The page area says the page, such as "Page 5 of 40", and gives the page's text as its value.
- Caret browsing (F7) puts a text cursor on the page, so the arrow keys move through the words.
- Focus Mode (Ctrl+4) shows the text as headings, paragraphs and lists. Screen readers can move by heading there.
- Read Aloud reads the text in the app's own voice and marks the sentence on the page.

## Platform limits

| Desktop | Limit | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| Linux, native Wayland | No accessibility tree reaches the screen reader. | Sign in to an X11 session, or keep `DISPLAY` set so the app uses XWayland. |
| Linux, X11 | Heading levels and list positions do not reach Orca. | Focus Mode headings and list items, and sidebar and dialog list items, say them in their description, such as "Heading level 2" or "2 of 7". |
| macOS | List positions do not reach VoiceOver. | Sidebar and dialog lists say their place in each item's description. Focus Mode lists do not. |
| All | The page has no text pattern, so a screen reader cannot move by word on the page itself. | Use Caret browsing, Focus Mode or Read Aloud. |

These limits come from the Avalonia UI framework. Related reports: AvaloniaUI/Avalonia#22376 and AvaloniaUI/Avalonia#22377.
